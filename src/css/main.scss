/*
Generic ITCSS Boilerplate Structure

This boilerplate has been modeled after the methodology created by Harry Roberts
For more information about the ITCSS methodology, visit: http://csswizardry.com/

Contents:

1. Settings
	 
	 Any project variables that are used globally: colors, fonts, etc.

2. Tools

	 Any mixins, animations, or functions used throughout the project.

3. Generic

	 This is where your reset/normalize & box-sizing styles go.
	 If using Normalize, for example, rename the reset file to generic.normalize.scss

4. Elements

	 Bare HMTL elements are styled in this section (<h1>, <a>, <p>, etc.)

5. Objects

	 Non-cosmetic design patterns including grid and layout classes

6. Components

	 Specific pieces of UI that are stylized. This typically ends up being where the majority of your sheets are created.

7. Trumps

	 Contains anything that beats/"trumps" all other layers, ie8 fixes, utility and helper classes, and other overrides.

8. Vendors

	Contains all vendor/3rd party plugins
